# Assignment 1a

I have visualized __Negative Binomial Distribution__ on the notebook

The Observable notebook link: [https://observablehq.com/d/258e9b1e71de8681](https://observablehq.com/d/258e9b1e71de8681)

The explanations are present in the notebook itself.

Please refer to the __Appendix__ at the end of the Observable notebook for the functions implemented for the Negative Binomial Distribution
